# About this task

In this program, a bitmap (bitmap) - a two-dimensional image, each pixel of which can be one of two colors, 
is represented as a multi-line string value and serves to determine how the user's message is displayed. In our bitmap, 
spaces correspond to white space, and all other characters are replaced by characters from the user message. 
The provided bitmap resembles a map of the world, but you can replace it with any other you wish. 
The simplicity of the "blank space or message characters" binary representation system makes it ideal for beginners.
