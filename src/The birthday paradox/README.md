# About this task
The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, is about the surprisingly high probability that two people have the same birthday, even in a relatively small group of people. In a group of 70 people, the probability of two people having the same birthday is 99.9%. But even in a group of just 23 people, there is a 50% chance of having the same birthday. The above program performs several probability experiments to determine percentages for groups of different sizes. Similar experiments with the definition of possible outcomes using
sets of random trials are called Monte Carlo experiments.
